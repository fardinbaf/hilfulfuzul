# হিলফুল ফুজুল সংঘ - Islamic Charity Organization Website


## Project Overview

This is a full-featured website for a charity organization, "হিলফুল ফুজুল সংঘ". It includes a public-facing site with information about the organization, donation options, and event showcases. It also features a comprehensive admin dashboard for managing the website's content dynamically.

### Key Features:

*   **Public Site:**
    *   Homepage with an image slideshow and key information.
    *   Donation page with payment instructions.
    *   About Us page with team member details.
    *   Contact page.
    *   Scrolling event notice marquee.
    *   Recent and upcoming events section.
*   **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`):**
    *   Secure area to manage website content.
    *   Manage Events (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    *   Manage Marquee Text.
    *   Manage Members.
    *   Manage Homepage Slideshow.

## Tech Stack

*   React
*   Vite
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   React Router
*   Lucide Icons for UI elements.
*   (Optional) Supabase for database and backend.

## Admin Panel Access

### How to Access
The admin panel is accessible by navigating to the `/admin` route of the website.
- **Local Development:** `http://localhost:5173/admin`
- **Deployed Site:** `https://your-site-url.com/admin`

### Login Information
**There is currently no authentication on the admin panel.** It is publicly accessible to anyone who knows the URL.

For a production environment, it is **strongly recommended** to secure this area. You can use Supabase Auth to easily add features like:
- Email and password login
- Social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Role-based access control

Until authentication is implemented, anyone can access the admin dashboard to manage the website's content.

## Connecting to Supabase for Database

This project is set up to work with local state by default. To persist your data, you can connect it to a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) backend. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and a real-time backend.

Follow these steps to connect your application to Supabase.

### 1. Create a Supabase Project

1.  Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up or log in.
2.  Click on "New Project" and give it a name and password.
3.  Wait for your new project to be provisioned.
4.  Once ready, navigate to **Project Settings** (the gear icon).
5.  Go to the **API** tab.
6.  You will find your **Project URL** and your `anon` **public** key. You'll need these for the next step.

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

For security, you should never hardcode your API keys directly in the code.

1.  Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
2.  Add the following lines to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and anon key:

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

    **Note:** Vite requires environment variables exposed to the client to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

### 3. Install the Supabase Client Library

Open your terminal and run the following command to add the Supabase library to your project:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 4. Create the Database Schema

You need to create tables in your Supabase database to store the application's data.

1.  In your Supabase project dashboard, go to the **SQL Editor**.
2.  Click on "New query".
3.  Copy and paste the following SQL script into the editor and click "RUN" to create the necessary tables. This script is idempotent, meaning you can run it multiple times without errors.

    ```sql
    -- Events Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
      title TEXT NOT NULL,
      description TEXT,
      date DATE NOT NULL,
      image_url TEXT,
      is_past BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
    );

    -- Marquee Text Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS marquee_text (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
      text_content TEXT NOT NULL
    );

    -- Members Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS members (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
      name TEXT NOT NULL,
      phone TEXT
    );

    -- Slides Table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS slides (
      id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
      url TEXT NOT NULL,
      caption TEXT
    );

    -- Enable Row Level Security (Recommended)
    -- These commands are idempotent; running them again won't cause an error.
    ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE marquee_text ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ALTER TABLE slides ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Create policies to allow access.
    -- The DROP statements make the script re-runnable without errors.
    
    -- Public read access policies
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read all events" ON events;
    CREATE POLICY "Public can read all events" ON events FOR SELECT USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read all marquee texts" ON marquee_text;
    CREATE POLICY "Public can read all marquee texts" ON marquee_text FOR SELECT USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read all members" ON members;
    CREATE POLICY "Public can read all members" ON members FOR SELECT USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read all slides" ON slides;
    CREATE POLICY "Public can read all slides" ON slides FOR SELECT USING (true);

    -- NOTE: For a production app, you would create more restrictive policies
    -- that only allow authenticated admin users to insert, update, or delete.
    -- For simplicity, these policies allow all actions for now.
    
    -- Admin management policies
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all events" ON events;
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all events" ON events FOR ALL USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all marquee texts" ON marquee_text;
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all marquee texts" ON marquee_text FOR ALL USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all members" ON members;
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all members" ON members FOR ALL USING (true);

    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all slides" ON slides;
    CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all slides" ON slides FOR ALL USING (true);
    ```

### 5. Create a Supabase Client Helper

Create a new file at `src/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client. This keeps your configuration clean and reusable.

```typescript
// src/supabaseClient.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
  throw new Error("Supabase URL or anin key is missing from .env file");
}

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

### 6. Update DataContext to Use Supabase

Now, you need to modify `src/context/DataContext.tsx` to fetch data from and send data to Supabase instead of using the local hardcoded state.

This involves:
1.  Importing the `supabase` client.
2.  Using a `useEffect` hook to fetch initial data from your Supabase tables when the app loads.
3.  Modifying the management functions (add, edit, delete) to be `async` and to call Supabase methods (`.from(...).select()`, `.from(...).insert()`, `.from(...).update()`, `.from(...).delete()`).

After following these steps, your admin dashboard will be fully connected to your Supabase backend, and all changes you make will be saved to your database.
